## Steps taken:
1) Set up ngrok account (https://dashboard.ngrok.com/observability/traffic-inspector)
2) added app.py and secrets.txt
3) added a folder to postman
4) created Strava api, registered webhook, checked that the webhook endpoint was working
    - Might need to update the urls by re-registering with updated tokens from the strava portal

5) [in progress] adding OAuth tokens

## Current MIT
